# Flight Reservation System (Java)

A console-based flight reservation system built in Java that allows users to search for flights, book reservations, and manage their bookings.
Features

Search Flights: Search for available flights by destination and date
Book Flights: Reserve seats on available flights
View Reservations: View all reservations for a specific customer
Real-time Seat Management: Prevents overbooking with synchronized booking operations
